# ðŸŽ“ TIL Week Two

**8/15/23** I don't really want to learn anything today. Will check back in if I do, but TIL I need a day off.&#x20;

I'll probably go add 2-4 more pages to MedModel and I guess I'll look for a better automated scheduling program with more specific reminders than GCal or Evernote. I also need to set up the MILO profile on BirdApp and automate tweets.

I guess TIL I don't like days off. I also need to link R and Jupyter notebook to the J Hopkins Study Repository.

TIL I can just use this to make lists to refer to as well. Now gimme that green GH.
