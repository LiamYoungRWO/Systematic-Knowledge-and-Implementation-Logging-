# today_I_Learned

This is a repository of things I learned each day, relevant to the fields of work, study, and general interest; that seem appropriate for this platform, but in a bulleted or otherwise consolidated style of formatting.

Camel casing is annoying so hopefully using it for the title will deter people from this seemingly arduous but necessary repository, if anyone actually ever subverts my plan to stay unnoticed forever. 

If I'm fortunate enough to have things go according to plan, and instead deter all traffic to an autonomous agent GitHub, in this, the magical age of autonomous popularity and proverbial data measuring between nerds; then I suppose this is a sort of secret yet not so secret (because it is public and all), nerd journal.

As the more you do things that  are real, the more they become private out of necessity.. and as of now I am committing far more than an average workday in hours to things that end up on this platform, I would like something to ensure that my mandatory green boxes are lit up as is the expectation.

Should I ever seek non self-employment status, the TIL protocol has been created so I can say "hey look... green boxes go brrrr"... this seems to be an easier alternative over otherwise having to explain why my boxes do not get greenified and should help to serve the dual purpose of reinforcing something I learned on any particular day, until I have the need for an ongoing public project which can take the place of this. 

Being that the goal is to open source much of what is being created.. hopefully the aforementioned occurrence becomes a reality sooner than later.
