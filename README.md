# today_I_Learned
A repository of things I learned each day, relevant to the fields of work, study, and general interest; that seem appropriate for this platform but in a bulleted style format.

Camel casing is annoying so hopefully using it for the title will deter people from this kind of dumb but neccessary repository if anyone actually ever subverts my plan to stay unnoticed forever, and instead deter all traffic to an autonomous agent GitHub, in this, the magical age of autonomous popularity and proverbial data measuring between nerds.

Becuase the more you do things that  are real, the more they become private out of neccesity.. committing far more than an everage workday in hours, but not getting my stupid green boxes lit up as is the expectation should I ever seek non self-employment status, the TIL protocol has been created. This is it.
