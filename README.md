# ðŸ”¦ The TIL Protocol

The TIL proto summarized by Anthropomorphic's "Claude"&#x20;



## Daily Learning Journal

This is a repository documenting things I have learned each day that are relevant to my fields of work, study, and general interests. The content is presented in a condensed, bulleted format for easy reference.

The cumbersome title using camel-Case is an attempt to deter visitors, as this is intended as a personal journal rather than a public site. My hope is that this repository will fly under the radar, serving as a private (yet public) nerd journal of sorts to record my daily knowledge.

As real-world projects increasingly become proprietary by necessity, this journal allows me to populate my GitHub profile with green contribution boxes, as expected in tech circles today. Should I ever seek traditional employment, this consistent green activity will preemptively answer questions about my lack of public commits during that time.

In the interim, this daily journal reinforces and preserves the things I learn across disciplines. My aim is to eventually open source much of what I'm working on as side projects, which can then take the place of this learning journal.

For now, this serves the dual purpose of documenting my knowledge while keeping my GitHub profile active with daily contributions. My goal is for those contributions to someday come from public open source projects instead of this private journal.
