# ðŸ”† TIL Week One

**08/07/23** Today I learned I can migrate and post 4 sites total in one day in some presentation format

**08/08/23** Today I learned something I already knew but had it reinforced on a topic of familiarity. There's a lot of money to be made in engagement farming with misinformation&#x20;

Today's TIL should really be a captain obnoxious reinforcement day, but TIL that I am way more productive on decent sleep&#x20;

**08/09/23** Today I learned new things about filing homeowners insurance claims and how to best maximize the end result regarding the incident that occurred to cause the need to file in the first place (massive hailstorm)

Damn... TIL that 2 days flew by and I didn't touch this working on that stupid interrogatory

Oh yeah.. and it's **08/12/23**&#x20;

**08/14/23** Today I learned that time goes by very quickly when writing a 137 page report to an OC who does not read prior relevant documents and reporting
