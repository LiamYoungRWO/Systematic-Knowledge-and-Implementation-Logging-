# ðŸ”† TIL Week One

**08/07/23** Today I learned I can migrate and post 4 sites total in one day in some presentation format

**08/08/23** Today I learned something I already knew but had it reinforced on a topic of familiarity. There's a lot of money to be made in engagement farming with misinformation&#x20;

Today's TIL should really be a captain obnoxious reinforcement day, but TIL that I am way more productive on decent sleep&#x20;

**08/09/23** Today I learned new things about filing homeowners insurance claims and how to best maximize the end result regarding the incident that occured to cause the need to file in teh first place (massive hailstorm)

Damn... TIL that 2 days flew by and I didn't touch this working on that stupid interrogatory

Oh yeah.. andn it's **08/12/23**&#x20;
