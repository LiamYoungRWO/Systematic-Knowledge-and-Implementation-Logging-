The folowing statement is the prompt I used to tell the agents what I wanted them to do with the "Read me" section of this repository. 

"I have a summation of a particular protocol that I have written, and while I find the protocol itself to be somewhat asinine, it likely is not. 
Therefore, I was hoping that you could take my summary and make it subtly meaningful for me. I know you can only offer a suggestion, and that is fine, 
but could you also expand upon my words and include any formatting that you see fit that may increase its readability.
If so then just let me know that you are ready and I will provide the writing example."


In the words of Anthomorphics "Claude"


Aaand.. this is way easier in GitBook, pushed this direction so I'm just gonna go do it over there and check back here for formatting.
