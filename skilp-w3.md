#### Installing R and RStudio

**Installing R**

1. Navigate to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website: [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. Select the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Download the installation package and run the installer.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

**Installing RStudio**

1. Visit the RStudio download page: [RStudio Downloads](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
2. Choose the free RStudio Desktop version suitable for your operating system.
3. Download the installer and execute it.
4. Follow the installation prompts to finalize the setup.

Upon successful installation of both R and RStudio, launch RStudio to access the integrated R environment.

Note: Ensure R is installed prior to installing RStudio, as RStudio requires the R runtime.
